  <p>
    Hi, I'm Somoye Ayotunde. I'm a
     
    <strong>
      Software Engineer
    </strong>
     
    and I chose it because I found my true passion in programming. Whether figuring out a difficult problem or crafting beautiful user experience like
    <strong>
       MEOLOGY
    </strong>
    , programming satisfies my desire for both constant learning and ongoing refinement.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      MEOLOGY 
    </strong>
    retrieves data from
     
    <strong>
      The Meal DB
    </strong>
     
    API. You can get to view a comprehensive list of meals based on your searchTerm and can also view the full details of each meal by clicking on the details. It is built using
     
    <strong>
      React
    </strong>
     
    and also utilizes
     
    <strong>
      Redux
    </strong>
    .
